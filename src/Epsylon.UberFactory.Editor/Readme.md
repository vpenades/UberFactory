### UberFactory Editor

This is a WPF application to help authoring and debugging UberFactory scripts.


#### Roadmap

- Hability to Cut/Copy/Paste entire tasks.
  - This requires copying the whole tree at DOM level, and then replace the GUIds

- Script Stats: we need a way of displaying all input files being used in the whole script.

- for both the Editor and the CLI tool, add Win7 shell extensions to display the progress bar in the taskbar icon.

- Preview could have a tooltip, telling if there's something to preview, and the kind of Object to preview; an image, a 3d model, etc

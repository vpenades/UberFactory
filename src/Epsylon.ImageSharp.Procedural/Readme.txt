Suggestions for ImageSharp:

- MetaData helper extension methods could use IImage now.
- Drawing methods that have an array as the last parameter, could use params PointF[] for ease of use.
- SignedRational(-5/10).ToString() seems to throw an exception
- ExifProfile.RemoveValue should not throw if the value doesn't exist

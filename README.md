# UberFactory
Content processor pipeline editor and evaluator

### TODO:

- Switch from Windows WPF to https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia
- Allow for XAML based GUIs for plugins, maybe by registering a specific GUI with an attribute, like: [Frontend("WPF","somefile.xaml")] or [Frontend("WPF","assembly.dll","controltypename")]

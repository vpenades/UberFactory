### UberFactory Editor

This is a WPF application to help authoring and debugging UberFactory scripts.


#### Roadmap

- Script Stats: we need a way of displaying all input files being used in the whole script.

- for both the Editor and the CLI tool, add Win7 shell extensions to display the progress bar in the taskbar icon.
